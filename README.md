# Ads-CTR-Forecasting
Ads CTR Analysis stands for Click-Through Rate Analysis for advertisements. Ads CTR Analysis is the process of examining the effectiveness of online advertisements by measuring the rate at which users click on an ad’s link to reach the advertiser’s website.
# Introduction
Ads CTR Analysis and Forecasting are crucial for businesses to assess the return on investment (ROI) of their advertising efforts and make data-driven decisions to improve ad performance. Below are the steps we can follow for the task of Ads CTR Analysis and Forecasting:
1. Gather ad data, including the number of ad impressions (how often an ad was shown), the number of clicks, and any other relevant metrics.
2. Explore the data to understand its characteristics and distribution. Calculate basic statistics, such as the mean CTR (Click-Through Rate) and standard deviation.
3. Create visualizations, such as line charts or bar graphs, to represent CTR trends over time.
4. Conduct A/B tests if necessary to compare the performance of different ad variations.
5. Analyze the CTR data to identify factors that influence ad performance.
6. Build a forecasting model to predict future CTR values.
